Homework 3: User Models and JavaScript for COMS 4170 by Prof. Lydia Chilton at Columbia (Spring 2024)

Warm-up:
Create a webpage with a single button that has the text “counter” on the button.
When the user presses it, two things happen (in this order):
  a. The JavaScript console has a message in it that says “I was clicked ” and has a
     random number.
  b. An alert box appears with some text. You can use any text except “foo”.
     You must use JQuery (not plain JavaScript or HTML) to register the click handler after the page
     has loaded.
Use a single HTML file that has all your HTML, and JavaScript code (and CSS if you use any).
